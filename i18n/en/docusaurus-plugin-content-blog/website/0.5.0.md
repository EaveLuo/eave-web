## 0.5.0 version:

There have been a lot of things recently, and the content has not been updated. This upgrade is mainly for docusaurus. Version 3.6 introduced byte's rspack, and the build and deployment speed has been significantly improved, which is also due to the optimization of Rust and the byte team. Although in the early stage of introduction, 3.6.1 [Chinese error problem](https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/issues/10646) and 3.6.2 [hot reload problem](https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/issues/10646#issuecomment-2487310052), but with the help of the byte team and the Docusaurus team, 3.6.3 has perfectly solved the above two problems, and the speed has taken off directly!

## 0.6.0 Plan:

### System

- [ ] Add PWA function
