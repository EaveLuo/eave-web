When the front-end project and the back-end project are not deployed on the same server or on different ports of the same server, the front-end project cannot access the back-end interface. In this case, a reverse proxy is needed to proxy the front-end request to the address where the back-end project is deployed.

### Preface

At present, mainstream front-end and back-end projects are designed in a separated way, with the front-end responsible for rendering pages and the back-end responsible for providing data interfaces. [`react19` seems to be playing with a "very new thing", server-side rendering, which can directly embed `sql` statements in the front-end project to operate the database. ](https://react.dev/reference/rsc/server-components) How to say it, `php` is back, and it is back in a new identity!

Letâ€™s get back to our topic: how to deal with the problem of backend interface proxy after nginx deploys the front-end project.

### Identify the problem

In the development stage, most scaffolds have built-in [`http-proxy-middleware`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-proxy-middleware) , and cross-domain access to backend interfaces can be completed through simple proxy configuration, for example:

```typescript title="Official examples"
import * as express from 'express';
import {
  createProxyMiddleware,
  Filter,
  Options,
  RequestHandler,
} from 'http-proxy-middleware';

const app = express();

app.use(
  '/api',
  createProxyMiddleware({
    target: 'http://www.example.org/api',
    changeOrigin: true,
  })
);

app.listen(3000);

// proxy and keep the same base path "/api"
// http://127.0.0.1:3000/api/foo/bar -> http://www.example.org/api/foo/bar
```

However, the proxy of `http-proxy-middleware` is only used in the development stage. It will not be packaged into the project during packaging, and is only used as a development dependency.

So how can we achieve the same effect by deploying the project through nginx?

### solution

Add one more location, taking the proxy api as an example:

```conf title="nginx.conf 1"
location /api {
    #Set the proxy target (backend interface address)
    proxy_pass https://api.eaveluo.com;
}
```

The above configuration forwards all requests with `/api` as `baseURL` in the front-end project to the back-end project `https://api.eaveluo.com/api`.

However, this has a problem for some requirements. If the back-end address does not have the `/api` prefix, it cannot be accessed normally. In this case, the following configuration can be used:

```conf title="nginx.conf 2"
location /api/ {
    #Set the proxy target (backend interface address)
    proxy_pass https://api.eaveluo.com/;
}
```

Note the subtle difference between the two snippets of code above. Compared to `nginx.conf 1`, `nginx.conf 2` has an additional `/` after `/api`, so that all requests with `/api` as `baseURL` can be forwarded to the backend project `https://api.eaveluo.com` without adding the `/api` prefix.
